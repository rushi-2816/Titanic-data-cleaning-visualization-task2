# 🧪 Titanic EDA - Internship Task 2

This project performs *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on the Titanic dataset as part of my AI & ML internship.

---

## 📁 Dataset Used
- *File:* train_sample.csv  
- Contains passenger data like Age, Fare, Sex, Class, and Survival status.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- Platform: Google Colab

---

## 📊 EDA Steps Performed
1. Loaded and viewed the dataset  
2. Checked missing values and descriptive stats  
3. Plotted:
   - Histogram (Age), Boxplot (Fare)
   - Countplots (Survival, Gender)
   - Correlation heatmap and pairplot
   - Interactive scatter plot (Plotly)

## 💬 Interview Questions & Answers

*1. What is the purpose of EDA?*  
- To understand the structure and patterns of data  
- To detect errors, outliers, and missing values

*2. How do boxplots help in understanding a dataset?*  
- They show the distribution, median, and spread  
- Highlight outliers clearly

*3. What is correlation and why is it useful?*  
- It shows how strongly two variables are related  
- Helps in selecting important features

*4. How do you detect skewness in data?*  
- Use histograms or .skew() function  
- Skew ≠ 0 indicates asymmetry

*5. What is multicollinearity?*  
- When two or more features are highly correlated  
- It affects model stability and interpretation

*6. What tools do you use for EDA?*  
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly  
- Google Colab for running and sharing notebooks

*7. Can you explain a time when EDA helped you find a problem?*  
- In the Titanic dataset, EDA revealed missing ‘Age’ values  
- Also found Fare outliers that were affecting the model

*8. What is the role of visualization in ML?*  
- It helps to understand data patterns and feature relationships  
- Makes insights easier to communicate
